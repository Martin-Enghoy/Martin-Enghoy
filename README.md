# Hey, you! I'm Martin. 🙋‍♂️
### Welcome to my personal corner of the Internet.

I am a Graduate of BSc in Computer Engineering from De La Salle University🏹 over at Manila City, Philippines.

I really love Web Dev, but I tend to learn everything tech under the sun. I am currently looking for a full-time job while I juggle my freelance work on two projects.

Currently, I am *trying* to learn and be confident in developing websites using Nextjs and Reactjs primarily in TypeScript. That and Tailwindcss for styling reigns supreme.
