### Hi there 👋

Hey, you! I'm Martin. Welcome to my personal kingdom of Code.

I am currently a 🎓graduating 💻Computer Engineering Student from 🏹De La Salle University over at 🌏Manila, Philippines.

I really 💘 Web Dev, but it's a love-hate relationship for now. I am currently developing a Python Website using Django for our Thesis which utilizes complex CSS, AJAX, Jquery and more that I will specify later.
